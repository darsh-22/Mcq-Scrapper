# MCQ-Scrapper

- MCQ-Scrapper is a scrapping tool which helps to scrap MCQ from any sites.

## Flow of code

- First need to create a **1.txt** file in which paste the copied HTML content of the site from which you want to scrap the MCQ's. Then run the *main.py* file.

## Modules

### BeautifulSoup

**Beautiful Soup** is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### Requests

The **requests** library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.


```bash
pip install requests
```

## Run code

```
python main.py
```
